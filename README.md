# Maze-Runner
A robot built with raspberry pi to probe, learn and solve any maze on it's own

##Assumptions:

The maze has no isolated blocks
There exists only one solution to the maze, one entrance and one exit.
All junctions and corners are at a 90 degree angle.
Raspberry pi pin mode: BCM
The maze is color coded (This is not a necessary assumption as the algorithm can work without the color code)
##Components used:

Ultrasonic sensors (for obstacle detection)
Color Sensors (for color detection)
##NOTE: This is not a necessary assumption as the algorithm can work without the color code
